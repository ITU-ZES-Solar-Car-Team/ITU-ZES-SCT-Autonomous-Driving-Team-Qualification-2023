This workspace is tested in ros galactic under Ubuntu Linux.

For installing ros-galactic, you can install from [this link](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)

For testing, firstly clone this repo and go to workspace directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ITU-ZES-Solar-Car-Team/ITU-SCT-Autonomous-Driving-Team-Qualification-2023.git
$ cd ITU-SCT-Autonomous-Driving-Team-Qualification-2023/itusct_assignment_ws
